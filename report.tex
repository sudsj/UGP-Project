\section*{Abstract}
An auction is a process of buying and selling goods or services by offering them up for bid, 
taking bids, and then selling the item to the highest bidder. 
So why are auctions important? In nutshell, it is important because certain goods might have some value to the seller,
and therefore the seller might have some reserved price below which the she would not be willing to sell.
If left to the market, the price might fall below that price.
Also, there do exist willing buyers who are ready to pay the higher value.
Moreover it has become a method of determining prices of goods. \\
Some salient features of using an auction are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Speedy Process, Quick Turnaround.
	\item Competitive Bidding.
	\item Auctions Work Well in Both Good and Bad Economic Times.
	\item No Negotiations.
	\item can get good idea of price.
	\item You Know Exactly When Your Property or Goods Will Be Sold.

\end{itemize}
Auctions have become an integral part of today's world, they are used extensively in almost every field. Some widely used auctions are spectrum auction, treasury auction, auction for advertisement, auctions for players such as in IPL or EPL leagues.\\ \\
Considering the need for auctions, we hereby present a software, which is generic enough to conduct several different auctions. \textbf{Auctionit}, is a software on which you can 
\\

\section*{Introduction}
AuctionIt allows auction designers to create and host auctions, users can place bids on items in the auction and can see the results and price they have to pay at the end of the auction process. Auction Designers can modify and create new fields which allow them to get more data from the bidders that is relevant to the auction being held. They can also choose from pre-defined auction templates to quickly set up some of the more common auctions. They can also define their custom allocation rules and pricing rules. This allows to set up complicated rules for pricing and allocation and thus provides more freedom to the designer to create a wide variety of auctions. 
The software, categorizes auction designers and bidders as different types of users. These accounts are password protected to prevent misuse and to ensure the auction is not compromised while it runs.
